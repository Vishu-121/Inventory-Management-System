# Inventory-Management-System
I made an inventory management system. A simple inventory management system is built with json files. In this project Customer can purchase products and generate bills.
Steps to use :-
1.Customer can enter the product ID and quantity of the product they want to purchase.
2.After entering the details, they can purchase products and bill will be generated with total billing amount.

We can generate 5 atributes per each product :-
1.Product ID 
2.Name of the product 
3.Amount 
4.Quantity 
5.Expiry date 
6.Billing Amount.

There are more than 30 products in the inventory. I have created two json files in this project: 1.record.json file is used to see the product details and 2.sales.json file is used to see transaction history.

Things that can be done in my project :-
1.Add new items to inventory 
2.Customer can purchase products 
3.Generate bills 
4.View Transaction History 
5.Update inventory

This repository based on inventory management system which consists of json files done during Skill India Python/AI internship
